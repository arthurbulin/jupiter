	Jupiter is a software package for analysis of Mercury output. In theory it could be used to analyze any orbital data if you have the
right data. It is mainly written in Python however the Frequency Modified Fourier Transform(fmft) is written in C. Mercury itself is 
writtn in Fortran77. 
	A few of the scripts contain code written by Dr.Nathan Kaib of the University of Oklahoma (big.in generation, AMDmonitor, and 
part of the FMFT script). Mercury was written by Dr.John Chambers and more information can be found here: 
http://www.arm.ac.uk/~jec/home.html The FMFT code was written by David 
Nesvorny of the Southwest Research Institute. More can be found here: https://www.boulder.swri.edu/~davidn/fmft/fmft.html 
	These codes are provided as part of the analysis routines. Any modifications will be noted in a README associated with the 
code. Any modification will be acompanied by the original code too. These codes are only intended for use with Jupiter. I can't 
guarentee the results of these codes when not used with Jupiter and I recommend if you want to use them, use the original code from 
the pages above.
	And as your genereal DISCLAIMER: No warrenty. I can't guarentee anything. I am not responsible for damage, data loss, etc. 
Back up your things.


Jupiter is written by Arthur Bulin of the University of Oklahoma(at the time of original writting) you can conntact me at 
arthurbulin@gmail.com please put JUPITER in the subject line or I cannot guarentee that I will see it.
